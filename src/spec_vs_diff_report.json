  "summary": "The implementation covers most frontend requirements and backend product catalog functionality. However, there are several missing UI sections and features specified in the BuildRequest, including the Shop page, some static content sections (About, Blog detail pages, Contact), and certain interactive features. The backend is functional but minimal.",
